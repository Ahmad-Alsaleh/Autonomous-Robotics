# TODO List

- [x] Add a flat, square floor with  a uniform color
- [x] Use E-puck robot
- [x] Make the size of the floor 20 times the size of the robot (i.e., 40 times the radius)
- [x] Add GPS to the robot (use the GPS demo)
- [x] Add pen to the robot (use the pen demo)
- [ ] Consider using PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) instead of proportional control

# Notes

1. Make sure the pen is positioned properly and that you enable it in your code
2. You are strongly advised to include appropriate comments in your robot controller code
3. The intensity of the attraction vector ***can*** be constant, but I (Alsaleh) feel it is better to make it proportional to the distance to the goal
4. I (Alsaleh) suggest making the intensity of the attractive force greater than the intensity of the repulsive force
