# Intelligent Autonomous Robotics - CMP 494-10

## Description

This repository houses our practical assignments and projects, all of which were developed using the [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) Simulator. The content is organized as follows:

- **HW 3 - Implementation of a Finite State Automaton in a Reactive Wheeled Robot for Simple Can Detection**
- **Project 1 - Implementation of Artificial Potential Field**
- **Project 2 - Implementation of A\* Path Planning and Waypoint Navigation in a Static Environment**
- **Project 3 - Autonomous Can Detection and Mapping with RRT\* and YOLO**

## Technologies Used

The assignments and projects are implemented using Python and the following libraries:

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): Used for real-time computer vision to read and manipulate images and videos.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): Used for numerical computations in Python.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): An open-source machine learning library used to create and train the neural network.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): A machine learning library in Python. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.
- [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5): State-of-the-art open-source object detection model from Ultralytics.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmad-Alsaleh/Robotics-Course
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch the desired world in Webots

4. Run the simulation

**Note: If YOLO is not already installed, it will be downloaded and installed when running Project 3's simulation. This may cause the simulation to take a while to start.**

## Credits

The assignments and projects were developed for the Intelligent Autonomous Robotics course at American University of Sharjah by [Ahmad Alsaleh](https://github.com/Ahmad-Alsaleh), [Ahmed Alabd Aljabar](https://github.com/akvnn), [Omar Ibrahim](https://github.com/amoor22), and [Yousef Irshaid](https://github.com/yousefbilal).

Immense gratitude is extended to Dr. Michel Pasquier for his invaluable mentorship during the duration of the course.
