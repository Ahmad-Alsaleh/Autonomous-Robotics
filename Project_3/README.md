# Intelligent Autonomous Robotics Coursework

## Description

This repository contains our practical homeworks and projects that were implemented using Webots Simulator. It breaks down into the following:

- **HW 3 - Implementation of a Finite State Automaton in a Reactive Wheeled Robot for Simple Can Detection**
- **Project 1 - Implementation of Artificial Potential Field**
- **Project 2 - Implementation of A\* Path Planning and Waypoint Navigation in a Static Environment**
- **Project 3 - Autonomous Can Detection and Mapping with RRT\* and YOLO**

## Technologies Used

The homework and projects are implemented using Python and the following libraries:

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): Used for real-time computer vision to read and manipulate images and videos.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): Used for numerical computations in Python.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): An open-source machine learning library used to create and train the neural network.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): A machine learning library in Python. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.
